# About me
I am a research scientist in occupational sleep medicine where I primarily provide fatigue countermeasures guidance and insights into sleep & circadian science for the aviation industry. I am actively involved in a collaborative, multidisciplinary research project (TriSafe) with the goal of understanderstandingâ€”and ultimately mitigatingâ€”the risk factors of cardiac emergencies in Ironman triathlons. I have a PhD in Nutrition & Exercise Physiology from Washington State University ('24) where I investigated how excessive training-related stress causes a maladaptive training response known as overtraining syndrome. 

I have over a decade of clinical experience working in Sports Medicine and Human Performance as an Athletic Trainer and Performance Coach where I closely worked with professional athletes (Football, Hockey) and collegiate athletes (Wrestling, Soccer, Lacrosse, Track & Field). 

I have experience in:

Written and Verbal Communication | Scientific Writing | Literature Synthesis & Appraisal | Cross-functional Collaboration | Project Management | Teaching Pedagogy | Data Management | Statistics | Data Analysis | Python | SPSS | Problem-Solving | Multi-tasking | Research Collaboration | Proteomics | Clinical Exercise and Lung Function Testing | Website Management | Content Creation 

ðŸ”­ **Iâ€™m currently working on**
- Final revisions of a journal manuscript examining sleep characteristics and sleep regularity in recreationally active adults during a three-week high-intensity training protocol (building off of my dissertation).
- Providing fatigue risk countermeasures guidance to pilots in the aviation industry (occupational sleep medicine).
- Investigating the underlying risks of cardiac emergencies during Ironman triathlons
- Qualiative data analysis of focus group transcripts regarding perceived risk of injury during Ironman triathlon competition

ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m currently learning**
- Refining my Python coding skills
- SQL (I understand the arguments and flow, but am working on practical experience through projects and online courses).
- Using Github and Visual Studio Code.
- Writing and communication skills (there's always room for improvement).


ðŸ’¬ **Ask me about**
- The relationship between sleep and (athletic) performance
- What breaking your foot 3x in a year (10 months) is like?
- How to improve sleep when traveling and reduce your jet lag
